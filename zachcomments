For Q1, the join seems to be not applied. For Q1.1, why not use Year EQ, but rather GT 1993 LS 1994


cub::CachingDeviceAllocator is a memory allocator class provided by the CUDA Unbound library (CUB). It is designed to allocate and deallocate memory on a CUDA device, and to cache previously allocated memory to reduce overheads associated with repeatedly allocating and deallocating memory.

Query parallelism: for deep tree, it might be better for one thread per tree. Like sort.

The crazy number in column files are garbage number just to fill the attribute size.

For hash join, it just indicate whether the join key exists, but do not store the tuple value in hash bins. (which makes a lot of sense to avoid join). However, based on the assumption of many-to-one.

The row length (LO_LEN) are hard coded in github1s:/src/ssb/ssb_utils.h
